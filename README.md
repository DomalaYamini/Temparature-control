# Temparature-control

temperature controlled dc motor using LM35
Components Needed:

DC Motor
LM35 Temperature Sensor
Arduino (or any other microcontroller)
Motor Driver 
Power Supply
Jumper Wires
Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
Heat Source (to test temperature changes)

Wrote a program to read the LM35 temperature sensor's output voltage, convert it to temperature, and control the motor speed accordingly.
